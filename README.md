# Me, Myeslf, and I

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Thomas Elton (@tjelton) and welcome to my GitHub account!

ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º I'm currently studying a Bachelor of Science and Advanced Studies (Dalyell Scholars) at the University of Sydney in Australia, completing majors in computer and data science.

ðŸ‘€ In particular, I'm really interested in how computer and data science can be used in interdisciplinary contexts. 
Part of this is a love for creating and designing, and making thorough software solutions which are well suited for their interdisciplinary purpose.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a casual academic with the School of Chemistry (at the University of Sydney) where I am desingning the 'ChemEd VR Toolkit'.
This toolkit is a collection of resources and software packages with the aim of aiding the development of VR applications specifically for Chemistry Education purposes (for example, making a VR chemistry lab, or creating a 3D space where students can visualise 3D molecules).
