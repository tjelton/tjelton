# Me, Myeslf, and I

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Thomas Elton and welcome to my GitHub account!

ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º I'm pursuing studying a Bachelor of Science and Advanced Studies (Dalyell Scholars) at the University of Sydney in Australia, completing majors in computer and data science. I'm currently on exchange at the University of Pennsylvania for a study year abroad.

ðŸ‘€ In particular, I'm really interested in how computer and data science can be used in interdisciplinary contexts. 
Part of this is a love for creating and designing, and making thorough software solutions which are well suited for their interdisciplinary purpose.
